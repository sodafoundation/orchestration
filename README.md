## Introduction

SODA Orchestration project is an open source workflow orchestration & automation framework. In a distributed environment, the business processes consist of several interconnected steps which may require streamline the process. SODA Orchestration provides orchestrating these processes to ensure accurate and faster execution with minimal manual intervention. The Orchestration framework provides flexibility to use existing workflows or define customized workflows to get the simplified execution of tasks.

It has a pluggable workflow engine. Currently we use the open source stackstorm. You can integrate any such workflow engines to SODA Orchestration.

This is one of the SODA Core Projects and is maintained by SODA Foundation directly. . However there can be other SODA Compliant Orchestration projects from partners in future which can be part of SODA Foundation Project Landscape
